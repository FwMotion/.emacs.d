Modify the lighter value displayed in the mode line for the given mode SPEC
if and when the mode is loaded.

SPEC can be either a mode symbol, or a list containing multiple elements of
the form (MODE VALUE FILE). In the latter case the two optional arguments are
omitted, as they are instead specified for each element of the list.

For minor modes, VALUE is the replacement lighter value (or nil to disable)
to set in the `minor-mode-alist' variable. For major modes VALUE is the
replacement buffer-local `mode-name' value to use when a buffer changes to
that mode.

In both cases VALUE is commonly a string, but may in fact contain any valid
mode-line construct. For details see the `mode-line-format' variable, and
Info node `(elisp) Mode Line Format'.

The FILE argument is passed through to `eval-after-load'. If FILE is nil then
the mode symbol is passed as the required feature. Both of these cases are
relevant to minor modes only.

For major modes you should specify the keyword :major as the value of FILE,
to prevent the mode being treated as a minor mode.
